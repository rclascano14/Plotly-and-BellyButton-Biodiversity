## Overview of Project

Throughout this project, I have been using Plotly.js as well as a javascript data visualization library to create an interactive data visualiation for the web regarding the biodiversity of belly buttons. With these skills, I am now completing a partially completed dashboard. Using the above resources, I will develop this dashboard through data visualizations detailing the top 10 bacterial species, bacterial cultures per sample, and belly button washing frequency. Additionally, all of this will be displayed on a creative and personalized dashboard. 

## Results
