# Plotly-and-BellyButton-Biodiversity
`Building an interactive dashboard using Plotly.js to explore data on the biodiversity of belly buttons. Then I will deploy the dashboard to a cloud server.`

## Resources
- JavaScript
- HTML
- Plotly
- D3.json()
- Github Pages

## Overview of Project

Throughout this project, I have been using Plotly.js as well as a javascript data visualization library to create an interactive data visualiation for the web regarding the biodiversity of belly buttons. With these skills, I am now completing a partially completed dashboard. Using the above resources, I will develop this dashboard through data visualizations detailing the top 10 bacterial species, bacterial cultures per sample, and belly button washing frequency. Additionally, all of this will be displayed on a creative and personalized dashboard. 

## Results

This weeks module consists of the following four deliverables:

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart

## Summary

In conclusion, the first visualizations created shows us that OTU 1167 is by far the most common Operational Taxonomic Unit in our bellybutton. The second visualization creates a bubble chart array of the various OTU's the samples possessed. The third visualization offers a gauge chart of belly button washing frequency and details that the average frequency is 1-2 times were week. Lastly, the fourth visualization shows a comprehensive look at the dashboard.
